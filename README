This is a simple dashboard for investigating personal radiation dose monitoring results issued by ARPANSA.

To use this, you will need to export the results from your area into a csv file.
This can be exported from the ARPANSA web portal.
Ideally, you should include all centres in the export.

You should also add names for your Centres, which can be found in the ARPANSA webportal.
These settings are adjusted in the 'centre_number_map.yaml' settings file.
A number of the role descriptions/numbers have been included in 'occupation_map.yaml', but your site may use different roles.
Without adding these, the results may be a bit inscrutable.

The csv file MUST be named 'exp_data.csv' and it must be kept in the same directory as the dashboard.
